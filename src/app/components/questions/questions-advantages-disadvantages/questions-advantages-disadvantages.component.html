  <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Starting a Nonprofit</h3>
  <span>
    There are many advantages to becoming a nonprofit. Tax exemption is a major advantage of becoming a 501c3 classified nonprofit. Once an organization is tax-exempt, any charitable donations made by individuals are tax-deductible. A nonprofit can also receive discounts on postage and advertising rates which makes for more efficient operation.<br/><br/><br/>
    Another advantage is legal protection, as the founders and members are generally not held personally responsible for a nonprofitâ€™s debts. The legal advantage is available without 501c3 status, as is the benefits that become available for employees, such as health and retirement plans. Furthermore, a nonprofit corporation that formalizes their existence improve the chances for longevity and success because the mission and vision must be clear and achievable.<br/><br/><br/>
    There are few disadvantages of becoming a nonprofit. Nonprofits cost money and time to start. Once a nonprofit is started, you must keep excellent records and make sure to file all paperwork yearly. This can be resolved by hiring the proper professionals to handle such details. Since nonprofits are there to serve the public, they are also under greater public scrutiny.
